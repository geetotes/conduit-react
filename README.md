### Run Locally

Simply run `npm install` and `npm start` and the app should appear. Please note that the app data is entirely backed by firebase, so if that is broken, then the app may not work

### Explore the code

Or don't. On second thought, you probably shouldn't. This code was written over the course of 48 hours, so it's not the best (Or maybe it is, since we won?).

### Inspired by

[Conduit](https://github.com/ngageoint/conduit) NGA's open source workflow tool.

Thanks to the [NGA](https://www.nga.mil) and [Blue Compass](http://bluecompass-llc.com/) for sponsoring the hackathon!
